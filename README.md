### DM Mini-Project 2

**Project Title:**  
Charting Unconventional Cinematic Pathways: Advanced Network Analysis of Actor Personas and Genre Evolution in the CMU Movie Corpus

**Abstract:**  
This project explores the CMU Movie Summary Corpus through advanced network analysis, machine learning, and natural language processing to uncover unconventional patterns in actor personas and genre evolution. It aims to unravel the intricate networks that shape actor careers, identify genre archetypes and evolution trends, and create machine learning models to predict box office revenue based on a combination of metadata and plot summaries. By leveraging graph theory, clustering, and time series analysis, this study will reveal the hidden cinematic pathways that underpin the evolution of the film industry.

**Data Analysis Questions:**  
1. **Actors' Career Networks:**  
   - How do actors navigate their roles within collaborative networks across different genres?  
   - How does an actor's network position impact their exposure to diverse genres, career longevity, and recognition?  
   - What clustering patterns emerge based on demographics like age, gender, and nationality?

2. **Genre Evolution and Cultural Trends:**  
   - How have genre popularity trends shifted over time, and how do these trends relate to historical and cultural milestones?  
   - Can we use clustering and natural language processing to uncover genre archetypes and their sub-genres?  
   - What role do regional and linguistic differences play in shaping genre preferences?

3. **Predictive Box Office Models:**  
   - What metadata features are the strongest predictors of box office revenue?  
   - How accurately can machine learning models estimate box office revenue by combining metadata with plot summaries?  
   - Does adding production and marketing cost data improve predictive accuracy?

**Methods and Results:**  
1. **Data Handling and Exploratory Analysis:**  
   - **Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Normalize formats, handle missing values, and transform textual data for analysis.  
   - **Descriptive Statistics:** Summary statistics for metadata and exploration of plot summary distributions using natural language processing.

2. **Actors' Career Network Analysis:**  
   - **Graph Network Analysis:** Apply graph theory to identify collaborative patterns, central actors, and demographic clustering.  
   - **Statistical Analysis:** Examine the correlations between network position, demographic data, and genre diversification.

3. **Genre Evolution and Archetype Analysis:**  
   - **Time Series Analysis:** Explore historical trends in genre popularity using time series and clustering.  
   - **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Analyze plot summaries to identify genre archetypes and sub-genres.

4. **Predictive Box Office Model:**  
   - **Feature Engineering:** Combine metadata with NLP features from plot summaries.  
   - **Model Training:** Train machine learning models (regression, random forests) to predict box office revenue.  
   - **Model Improvement:** Integrate additional production and marketing datasets for higher accuracy.
